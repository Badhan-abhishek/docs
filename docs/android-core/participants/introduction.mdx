# Introduction - Participants

The data regarding all meeting participants is stored under `meeting.participants`. This **does not** include the local user. Use the methods and events to consume the participants data. 
For example, to get all the participants who joined the meeting:

```kotlin
// get all joined participants
val joinedParticipants = meeting.participants.joined;
```

The `meeting.participants` object has the following properties.

- `joined`: A list that contains all the participants who have joined the meeting.
- `waitlisted`: A list that contains all the participants waiting to join the meeting.
- `active`: A list that contains all the participants except the local user who are supposed to be on the screen at the moment 
- `pinned`: A list that contains all the pinned participants of the meeting.

Therefore, if you were to make a grid of participants, you'd use the `active` list, but to display all participants in the meeting you'd use the `joined` map.

Each participant in each of the `joined`, `waitlisted`, `active`, and `pinned` list is of type [`DyteMeetingParticipant`](../../Reference/DyteParticipant). Read more about each individual `participant` object [here](../participant-object).

You can subscribe to various events on the participants by implementing `DyteParticipantEventsListener` and passing the object to `meeting.addParticipantEventsListener(dyteParticipantEventsListener)`.

### Video update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the video using `enableVideo` or `disableVideo`

```kotlin
meeting.self.addParticipantEventsListener(object : DyteParticipantEventsListener {
     override fun videoUpdate(videoEnabled: Boolean, participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      super.videoUpdate(videoEnabled, participant)
      if (videoEnabled) {
        // video is enabled, and other participants in room can see local user
      } else {
        // video is disabled, and other participants in room can not see local user.
      }
    }
});
```

### Audio update

Triggered when the user starts / stops the audio using `enableAudio` or `disableAudio`

```kotlin
meeting.self.addSelfEventsListener(object : DyteSelfEventsListener {
    override fun audioUpdate(audioEnabled: Boolean, participant: DyteMeetingParticipant) {
      super.audioUpdate(audioEnabled, participant)
      if (audioEnabled) {
        // audio is enabled, and other participants in room can hear local user
      } else {
        // audio is disabled, and other participants in room can not hear local user.
      }
    }
});
```

## Move between pages in paginated mode

The `nextPage() and previousPage()` method allows you to switch between pages of participants present in the meeting.

```kotlin
// switch to next page
meeting.participants.nextPage();
```
 
## Host control methods

The `meeting.participants` object has host control methods that allow you to disable the audio and video streams of other users in the meeting (given that the user preset has the right permissions).

```kotlin
// mute all participants
meeting.participants.disableAllAudio();


// disable video for all participants
meeting.participants.disableAllVideo();
```

To remove all participants from a meeting, you can call the `kickAll()` method.

```kotlin
// remove all participants from the meeting
await meeting.participants.kickAll();
```
